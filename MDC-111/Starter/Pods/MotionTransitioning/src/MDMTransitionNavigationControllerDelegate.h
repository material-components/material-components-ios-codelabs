/**
 This class provides a singleton implementation of UINavigationControllerDelegate that makes it
 possible to configure view controller transitions using each view controller's transition
 controller.

 This class is not meant to be instantiated directly.

 The +delegate should be assigned as the delegate for any UINavigationController instance that
 wishes to configure transitions using the mdm_transitionControllerÂ (transitionController in Swift)
 property on a view controller.

 If a navigation controller already has its own delegate, then that delegate can simply forward
 the two necessary methods to the +sharedInstance of this class.
